Nineteen years ago, I started using Dausha.net as my personal blog domain. I've [briefly mentioned](/technology/frustration-with-zerigo/) its evolution before. Over the next year, another major change is coming.

<!-- more -->

About ten years ago, I picked up the nickname "Merovex" while playing an online game. Since then, I've chosen to use it in many different ways. This includes using it as the new name for my imprint. I held a contest and created a new logo in 2016. I have since filed for trademark protection for both logo and name. The logo was approved a few months ago, and the trade name is in the final stages.

In previous posts, I've talked about Godaddy as domain registrar. I now leverage [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com). Its user interface is far friendlier than Godaddy. Instead of using Dausha.net, I will move to Merovex.com and ultimately retire my old, comfortable domain.

I also use [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart) to host the website. The content is statically generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), as [I mentioned in 2015](/technology/octopress-to-jekyll/). I used Heroku to host the site for a few years. Recently, I've been using [Github's Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's a wonderful solution when used with Jekyll as you can created content right on Github, but I chose to go down the Firebase route.

The last change was a return. I shifted to using [Materialize](diary/strange-things-afoot/) instead of Bootstrap for site's theme and styling. I'm returning to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as it goes to its new version.

So to summarize, I am still using Jekyll but am moving to a new domain leveraging Google's services.
