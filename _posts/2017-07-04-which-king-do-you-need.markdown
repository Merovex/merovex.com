Over a thousand years, the Anglo-American culture has struggled over the question of central authority---who should rule. Today marks the anniversary when Americans rebuked central authority. Along the theme of centralized authority, I wanted to explore a question of centralized religious authority that I encountered.

Stephen Crowder recently hosted Catholic apologist Michael Voris[^CRTV] in response to a Twitter movement to convert Crowder to Catholicism. Voris described Catholic position as the one true church because it has the unbroken succession from Christ through Peter and the Papacy. To create this unbroken succession, Voris dismissed various rival popes, different sects of Christianity, and heretical statements and actions by various Popes in history. He simultaneously discussed how various clergy through history led the people astray, referring to Martin Luther. He asserted only the Church had authority to interpret Scripture, and any interpretation outside the Church's doctrine is heresy.[^contradiction]

While Voris generally failed in his arguments due to an over-reliance on logical fallacy, at one point he posited a rhetorical question: "having recently risen, would Christ subject his church to 1500 years of idolatry?" Voris' point was that Christ would not do such a thing, therefore the 1500 years before Protestantism were not idolatry, and the Pope is legitimate.

Voris' question fails to take into consideration Biblical history. After the flood, the people sought a way to remain united (rather than disburse as God commanded), leading to the Tower of Babel. After 400 years of bondage, God freed his people from Egyptian captivity. Because they were unwilling to rely on his promise, he subjected them to two generations of wandering. After finally attaining the promised land, within a few generations they demanded a King. God warned them of the despotism that would befall an autocrat, yet they persisted and he relented. One thousand years before Christ, the Israelites got their king. As a result, they suffered for centuries. However, God always kept a few loyal followers to restore his people. From the Old Testament, we see God expects a direct relationship with his people without an intermediary.

Why the Pope emerged is lost to history. The church formed after Christ rose and the Holy Spirit was given to the people. Peter was one of the many executed by Nero and one could expect Christians to seek a new leader for unity. We see in the New Testament that false doctrines were already emerging, and false teachers practiced. That a few grasped onto Clement or Linus as Peter's successor is reasonable to expect.

Catholics assert that Jesus gave Peter unique authority in Matthew. If true, they fail to establish that this authority was heritable or that Peter conveyed it before his death. Yet from this authority they assert being the one true church. We see in the Papal history characteristics of the Jewish kings in their despotism, not the imbued authority of Christ. Even Voris implied that the current Pope engaged in heresy.

What we know is this: God sent Jesus to save all mankind. Jesus removed barriers between us and Him. Throughout the Bible we see God seeking for us to rely only on him. The priesthood was abolished. None of the Catholic hierarchy needs to exist for a Christian to have a full and meaningful relationship with God. It serves as an impediment for good Catholic christians to come to rely on God alone. We don't need kings or popes, but the Lord Jesus Christ alone.

[^contradiction]: He also stated that one can be saved without Christ through good works only to later state that one could only be saved through Christ and taking of the Sacrament.
